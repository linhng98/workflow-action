# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    # Job name is Greeting
    name: Greeting
    # This job runs on Linux
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # This step uses GitHub's hello-world-javascript-action: https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action
      - name: Hello world
        uses: actions/hello-world-javascript-action@v1
        with:
          who-to-greet: 'Mona the Octocat blabla'
        id: hello
      # This step prints an output (time) from the previous step's action.
      - name: Echo the greeting's time, bobo
        run: echo 'The time was ${{ steps.hello.outputs.time }}.'
      # Just added a badge
      - name: Added badge status
        run: echo 'see my status badge'
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Map a step output to a job output
    outputs:
      output1: ${{ steps.step1.outputs.test }}
      output2: ${{ steps.step2.outputs.test }}
    steps:
    - id: step1
      run: echo "::set-output name=test::hello"
    - id: step2
      run: echo "::set-output name=test::world"
  job2:
